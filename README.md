# Sign Language Translation Glasses

Glasses that translate certain ASL gestures, with a few other fake gestures created so showcase my model's efficiency.
The AI model was created by me and is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5 due to the fact that it is the smallest Single-Board Computer I could obtain that could comfortably run this model.
I was also forced to use a USB camera because of the fact that the current OS of the PI 5 (Bookworm) forces you to use libcamera/rpicam which is not compatible with OpenCV. 

I'll eventually try to find a way to make my device more compact and not relying on a backpack so it is more useable.

A short look at the device can be seen below:
